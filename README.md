# Capitol Battle Royale

## Overview

Capitol battle royale is a top down hero shooter

Graphics will be in retro type as to minimize effort.

Okay time for gameplay loop

every squad will have their own private jet and in the middle of the map they will crash so there is a spread player population but also early game fights can happen. Imagine a plane from each angle coming in so some people are bound to drop the same area but some cant since their plane coming from the other side.

Once dropped players will find ground loot. Ground loot might have tiers like fortnite, loot will be: pistol, shotgun, ar, sniper, rpg, grenade, smoke grenade, gas grenade. There will be different tiers of body armour, backpacks and meds aswell. We can think of creative weapons/grenades together. The map will be tthe capitol area.

squads will be squads of three, and there will be duos aswell. You will have a sprint on a cooldown timer like breath of the wild, you will have dodge roll which gives you extremely short i frames and good movement, you will have limited line of sight for players, think of it like you can see the entire map top down (of course only the section you are in) but you only have a certain cut of the pie to see players. Walls will obsucure the view of players of course, unless they are revealed in which the red outline will be seen even if they are not in the line of sight. Okay now time for the fun part, heroes! Like apex legends, each hero will have one unique ability on a cooldown, one passive, and one ultimate. Here are some examples

Trump: passive will be more ammo holding cause fat idk. ability will be wall, which will bring up a wall which is able to be broken if shot at, but cannot be seen through, will stay up for ten seconds if not shot at. Ultimate will be riot! which will spawn in some rioters who will homing target the enemy and act as cover for trump who will appear to be one of the rioters. If trump is shot while in riot form he is revealed, but the rioters will continue homing in on the enemy, each rioter will have 10 health, and if they reach the enemy deal 5 damage. Basically rabbit escape from jjk

Obama: (he is gonna be the recon character) passive will be extended line of sight. Ability: deploy a drone, basically crypto from apex, have like a 100 meter radius and can scan enemys to reveal their location for 5 seconds, can be destroyed. while using drone he stands still and is not controled ultimate: drone strike, it has to be activated in drone mode, arms the drone with missles that can be shot, 4 missles, each dealing 20 damage, but the missles can be shot out of the air to ensure they arnt broken

Ben Shapiro: passive will be smaller hitbox (he is short). Ability: Wall of truth. Facts do not care about feelings and the wall of truth will be like a bubble shield, you cant shoot through it either though. Ultimate: Orbital lazer, make a targetted lazer strike from orbit, useful when pairing with bubble cause it cant break through bubble, but this means orbital lazer will hurt teamates and ben himself

Biden: passive faster rolling (cause he falls alot). Ability: sniff, sucks in players towards him like a roadhog chain except not as close, kinda like the twister from clash royale type effect. He is still vulnearable when sniffer, so it would best be paired with a teamate with a shotgun, or sucking them into a grenade. Ultimate: nap time! enemies in a 20 meter radius of him get a snooze effect which makes them unable to dodgeroll or use abilities, good pairup for sniff so he can suck them into ult radius

Bush: lowkey idk
